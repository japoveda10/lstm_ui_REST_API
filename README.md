# LSTM UI REST API

Welcome! 

![Django REST Framework Browsable API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/japoveda10/lstm_ui_REST_API/master/lstm_ui_REST_API/IMAGE.PNG)

## What is it?

This is a **REST API** for the [LSTM UI Project](https://github.com/japoveda10/lstm_ui_vuejs).

## How was it built?

This REST API was built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

## How can I run it?

**1. Download the project**

Download this GitHub repository. To do so, you can execute the following command in your cmd/terminal window:

   `$ git clone https://github.com/japoveda10/lstm_ui_REST_API.git`

2. **Add the settings.py file to the project**
   
Request the `settings.py` file to [japoveda10](https://github.com/japoveda10). When you get it, place it inside the     `lstm_ui_REST_API` folder (where the `urls.py` and `wsgi.py` files are)

**3. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**

**4. Create a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies** 

If you are using **Windows**, follow the instructions available [here](https://programwithus.com/learn-to-code/Pip-and- virtualenv-on-Windows/). If you are using **macOS**, follow the instructions available [here](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-   setup/Python/virtualenv.html). 

**Important:** the virtual environment setup instructions for Windows and macOS were not written by us (we are linking you to an external information source).

**5. Install Django** 

You can use pip to install it (make sure you have created and activated a virtual environment for this project):

   ```
   $ pip install django
   ```

If you are using **Windows**, download Postgres from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/) and install it following the WizardÂ´s instructions. The superuser password has to match the PASSWORD field from `settings.py`. Then, edit the PATH environmental variable to include:
   
   `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\bin`
   
   `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\lib`
   
   
If you are using **macOS**, execute the following command:
   
    ```
    $ pip install postgres
    ```

**8. Run Postgres**

If you are using **Windows**, in a new Command Propmt execute:
   
   ```
   $ pg_ctl -D "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\data" start
   ```

If you are using **macOS**, execute the following command:
   
   ```
   $ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
   ```
   
**9. Configure database**

Execute the following commands to configure the database (for **Windows** and **macOS**):

   ```
   $ unset PGUSER
   ```
   
   ```
   $ createuser -s postgres
   ```
   
   ```
   $ createdb EventLogs
   ```

**10. Migrate Django databases**

Execute the following commands (make sure you are located inside the same folder where the `manage.py` file is):
   
   ```
   $ manage.py migrate
   ```

**11. Run the project**

Execute the following command:

   ```
   $ manage.py runserver
   ```
   
Then, open your web browser and go to:

   ```
   https://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

**12. Stop Postgres after using this project**

If you are using **macOS**, when you finish using the app, you can stop Postgres executing the following command:

   ```
   $ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop
   ```
   
If you are using **Windows**, when you finish using the app, you can stop Postgres executing the following command:

   ```
   $ pg_ctl -D "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\data" stop
